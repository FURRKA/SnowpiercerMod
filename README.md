# SnowpiercerMod

Hello! This is my first mod for factorio. I made this mod because I really love the world Snowpiercer. Factorio seemed like the perfect platform for me to recreate the world.
This mod adds 2 trains, a reinforced freight car and a power cell to power the trains. Mod settings support changing the maximum speed of the train.

Yes, the mod is simple, but it was a good experience to create mods for this wonderful game. :)
